                            Nepal adopted the multi-university concept in 1983. The idea of Pokhara University (PU) was
                            conceived in
                            1986; however, it was established only in 1997 under the Pokhara University Act, 1997. The
                            Incumbent
                            Honorable Prime Minister and the Honorable Minister for Education of the Federal Democratic
                            Republic
                            Nepal are the Chancellor and the Pro-Chancellor, respectively. The Chancellor appoints the Vice
                            Chancellor, the principal executive officer of the university. The Registrar is designated to
                            assist
                            him/her in financial management and general administration. A non-profit autonomous institution,

                            is
                            partly funded by the Government of Nepal and partly by revenues from its students and affiliated
                            colleges.
